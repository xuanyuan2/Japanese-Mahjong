My first college-level game project, Japanese Mahjong (or richii mahjong). 
Licensed under GNU GPL.
Utilizes SFML 2.1 (licensed udner zlib/libpng).
Developed in Visual Studio 2012, provided by Microsoft DreamSpark.

This project uses a client-server architecture, so the server is actually a separate project. They are deeply intertwined, however.
